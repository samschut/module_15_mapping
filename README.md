# module_15_mapping
Creating a map in VS code
In this project, a map will be made to represent data on earthquakes across the globe. This map will look at the last 30 days and create a map that will show circles representing the magnitude, a heatmap for quantity and marker clusters. These options can be manipulated by the user.
